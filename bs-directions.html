<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    
   <li>Pat meat dry with paper towels. Do not season. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a Dutch oven over high heat until it shimmers. Add half of the beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat if oil begins to smoke or fond begins to burn. Transfer beef to the slow-cooker.</li>
   <li>Repeat with remaining beef and 1 tablespoon olive oil, then add to the slow-cooker.</li>
   <li>Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to the now-empty dutch oven if needed, add the onion and carrots. Cook, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits, until onion is softened, 3-4 minutes.</li>
   <li>Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Add garlic, tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
   <li>Slowly add the wine, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits. Increase heat to high and allow wine to simmer until thickened and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the beef stock. </li>
   <li>Pour the vegetable stock mixture into the slow-cooker. Stir in the bay leaves, thyme, and salt pork. </li>
   <li>Cook on low for 4-6 hours (or high for 3-4 hours). 2 hours before eating, remove the salt pork and add the potatoes.</li>
   <li>30 minutes before eating stir in the peas. IMPORTANT: Season with salt and pepper. Enjoy!</li>
