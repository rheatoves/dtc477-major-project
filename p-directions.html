   <li>In a large bowl whisk the egg (or egg replacer), granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, and the vegetable oil together. </li>
   <li>Add the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (leave out if your flour already has it), gluten-free baking powder, and salt to the egg mixture and mix until fully combined. </li>
   <li>Stir in milk and mix until smooth. For thinner pancakes stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk.</li>
   <li>Scoop the batter into a Â¼ cup measuring cup and pour the batter onto a greased griddle or pan for each pancake.</li>
   <li>Cook the pancakes until the batter starts to bubble and pancakes start to puff. Flip/turn the pancakes and cook the pancakes until they are golden brown. </li>
   <li>Top with butter, syrup or favorite topping. Enjoy!</li>
   <li>These pancakes can be frozen and reheated in the microwave.  To freeze the pancakes, allow them to completely cool and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet and flash freeze them for 10 minutes. Flash freezing them keeps them from sticking together. Once the pancakes are flash frozen, you can remove them from the baking sheet and place them inside a freezer-safe bag or air-tight container.</li>
