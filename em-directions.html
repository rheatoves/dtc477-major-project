<h2>Directions</h2>

   <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spray or grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin.</li>
   <li>Place the spinach in a colander and let warm water run over it until it is thawed, about 1 minute (some brands take a bit more effort to defrost: you can also use a microwave if necessary). Then use your hands to squeeze out as much excess liquid as you can.</li>
   <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Then stir in the oregano, salt, garlic powder, cottage cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, spinach, and roasted red pepper. Add a few grinds of fresh ground black pepper if you like.</li>
   <li>Fill each muffin cup three-quarters of the way to the top with the egg mixture. Sprinkle the tops with additional chopped roasted red pepper.</li>

   <li>Bake 22 to 24 minutes until set in the center and golden around the edges. Allow to cool for a few minutes (they’ll deflate, which is expected), and then run a butter knife around the edges of each muffin to loosen it and pop it out. Enjoy immediately or store refrigerated for up to 5 days: you can eat them cold, room temp, or re-warmed. (You can also freeze them for up to 3 months and defrost by placing them in the refrigerator overnight.)</li>
